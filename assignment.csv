Whitewater Preserve,"This is my favorite place to hike back near my hometown. There's beautiful sprawling hills, wild mountain goats, tortoises, and toads everywhere.

Mount San Jacinto,This is the main mountain that overlooks the Coachella Valley where I'm from. In third grade we got to go up an aerial tramway and go sledding in the snow up on the mountain.

Rancho Mirage High School,"This is where I went to high school. I was the third class to ever graduate from the school, so the school was very nice and clean which was nice.
